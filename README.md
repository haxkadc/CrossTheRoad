# CrossTheRoad
University Project: this project recreates a fully automated arcade game.

##
## Description

The aim of the game is to cross the various lanes of the road in the shortest time possible without being hit. The player takes on the role of a chicken (agent) that moves in the appropriate direction. There are obstacles that cause immediate death, such as trees, benches and cars. To overcome them, the agent must make predictions using the trained model on what is the best move to make to reach the objective.
